## Introduction to Smart Farming Management Database System
Agriculture is the backbone of many economies, and modern technology can significantly improve its efficiency. The Smart Farming Management Database System is designed to help farmers and agricultural businesses manage their resources efficiently. This full-stack web application will integrate real-time monitoring, data analysis, and automation to enhance productivity and sustainability. The platform will enable farmers to track crop health, monitor weather conditions, manage inventory, and access market insights, making farming more data-driven and profitable.


### The project will utilize the following technologies:
#### Frontend:
1. React.js â€“ For building a dynamic and fast UI
2. CSS3 â€“ For styling and responsiveness
3. JavaScript (ES6+) â€“ For interactive elements
#### Backend:
1. Node.js â€“ For handling server-side logic
2. Express.js â€“ For building APIs
3. SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL) â€“ For managing structured database queries
#### Other Tools:
1. REST API â€“ For seamless communication between frontend and backend
2. AWS S3 / Microsoft Azure Blob Storage â€“ For storing farming-related data and images
3. Authentication (JWT, OAuth) â€“ For secure access
4. WebSockets â€“ For real-time updates


## Features that are to be added: 

1. **Farmer Profiles**  
2. **Crop & Livestock Categories**  
3. **Real-time Weather & Soil Monitoring**  
4. **Monitoring Equipment Maintenance**  
5. **Monitoring Pest Control**  
6. **Farmer can monitor Multiple Farms**  
7. **Tracks Crop Growth Period**  
8. **Managing Workers**  
9. **Tracking Irrigation Schedules**  
10. **Creating Farm Reports**  
11. **Dividing Farms into sections for better Monitoring**  

These features will **enhance farming efficiency, provide real-time insights, and help Farmers track their vast farms**
